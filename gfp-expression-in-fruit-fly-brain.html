In ideal conditions flies would remain in formaldehyde overnight and brain dissections would begin the following day.  Each vial of flies, control and experimental, should remain in the formaldehyde for equal amounts of time (Figure 4., Appendix I)

                <p>
                  Two forceps were used to dissect fly brains and dissections were completed under the 2.5 magnification setting of a stereo microscope.  Fly dissections occurred on a standard cover slid while flies were immersed in saline solution.  Upon completion of a successful dissection, brains were transferred to a new cover slid with a glass dropper and excess saline solution was cleared with a Kim wipe.  Flies were dissected in the following pattern: five control brains were fist dissected, immediately followed by the dissection of five experimental brains.  This pattern was alternated with every dissection session.  After the first 5 brains were dissected (Control or Experimental), brains were placed in a safe location during the dissection of the next 5 brains (Control or Experimental).  Upon completion of dissections, GFP imaging began immediately (Appendix II).

              <p>
                The first brains dissected were also the first brains to be imaged.  This is done so both groups –control and experimental– receive equal amounts of time on a dry cover slide.  GFP imaging was done in the darkest conditions possible.  Therefore, cardboard was used to cover the window of the door to the entrance of the lab.  GFP analysis was conducted with a progress pro capture camera mounted on the stereoscope.  The GFP Imaging camera settings used are as follows: Stereoscope magnification 6.3, exposure time 100 (ns), Gain was set to (1) its lowest possible setting, and images were taken in black and white mode.  Images were saved with following settings: 4080 x 3072 9x Scan, and saved as a high quality-large JPEG file (Appendix III).

          Discussion
        </h3>
        <p>
          Photoirradiation treatment does appear to increase GFP expression in the fruit fly brain. However, it also appears that formaldehyde, which is used to fix brain tissue prior to dissection,
           also effects the GFP expression measurement. Therefore, in
           subsequent studies where GFP fruit flys and brain dissections are used, the time a brain is in formaldehyde must be consistent for every brain measured.
